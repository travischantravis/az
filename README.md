# react-node-template

React Node Template is a simple, unopinionated, full stack web app template, with the goal of facilitating quick prototyping and deployment to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or elsewhere.

This template combines a **client** generated by `create-react-app` and a **server** generated by `express-generator`.

In local dev, the React dev server & Node server are run side by side, with API calls [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) through the React dev server to the Node server. In production, the Node app will serve both the static React production build and the API.

## Development

### Project Structure

- `src/client` contains the [React](https://reactjs.org/) app
- `src/server` contains the [Node](https://nodejs.org/) [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) app
- `package.json` in the project root contains scripts to run in dev mode locally, and also to build and run on Heroku

### Local Dev Setup

All commands run from project root:

1. `cd src/client && npm install`
2. `cd src/server && npm install`
3. Make sure `nodemon` & `concurrently` are installed globally
4. I used the API token approach for authentication. Create a `.env` file inside `src/server` and include `BASIC`, a 64 bit encoded string. More details found [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/#api-token)
5. `npm run dev`

### Testing

React-Testing-Library is used for unit test. Run `cd src/client && npm run test` to execute tests

### Client<->Server Communication

The Node Express.js server is initialized with one router mounted at `/api`. We've implemented a sample route at `/api/users`. Edit the `src/server/routes/api.js` file to add your own routes and server-side logic.

In the React app, you can see in `src/client/src/App.js` where we're calling `/api/users` using `fetch`. `App.js` is a [functional component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components), so you can see how we're using `useEffect` to call our API on component mount, and `useState` to update component state when we receive a response from the API.
